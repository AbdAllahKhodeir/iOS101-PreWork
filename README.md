## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

List of Apps I like
 - TikTok
    - Offers a seamless video watching experience
    - Accurate video recommendations
      
 - LinkedIn
    - Great User Interface
    - Good post recommendation

 - WhatsApp
   - Great chat experince, quick and easy
   - Great video calls experience


## App Improvement Idea:

An enhancement for the LinkedIn iOS app could be the integration of a **Career Path Insights** feature. This feature would leverage AI and machine learning to analyze a user's professional journey, educational background, skills, and industry trends. It would then provide personalized recommendations and insights on potential career paths, job transitions, and skill development opportunities. The app would offer suggestions for relevant courses, certifications, or networking events that align with the user's desired career trajectory. Additionally, it could highlight profiles of successful professionals who have followed similar paths, showcasing their achievements and offering inspiration. 

## Notes

Using and understanding Xcode for the first time was a challenge. I was able to navigate around and figure out how it works.
